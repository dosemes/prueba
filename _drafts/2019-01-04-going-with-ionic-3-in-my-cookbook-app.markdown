## My Cookbook

My Cookbook is a digital cookbook and pantry.

In the Pantry, you can track the number of your ingredients.

Based on the contents of your Pantry Cookbook shows which dish you can prepare immediately. Dishes are marked when there is lack of some ingredients. There is shown which ingredient is lack of and how many of it.

I used [Ionic] v1.
