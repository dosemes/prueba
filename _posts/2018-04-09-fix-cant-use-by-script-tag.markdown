## I made a mistake

I configured [Webpack] for an app, not for library and that was the mistake I made.
[Start your own JavaScript library using webpack and ES6] post was very helpful and [Authoring Libraries] from Webpack documentation.
I changed [Webpack]'s configuration. [SimpleDebugger] can be used as `<script>` tag in a browser.

## What else I changed

### I extracted Logger

I changed conception and [SimpleDebugger] is whole library now.
For now, it has only Logger module.
Logger is tool for logging the messages like [SimpleDebugger] was.
So functionally nothing is changed.

### ClassNames refactor

I refactored ClassNames and every class is written in [kebab-case].

### Demo

I've changed code [Demo].
[SimpleDebugger] is loaded as a global variable.
You can play with it, e.g.:

```js
var myLogger = new SimpleDebugger.Logger(0);

myLogger.add('Testing... Testing...');
```
