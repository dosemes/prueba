## Demo Page

I prepared Demo Page for testing and adding new features purposes.

I prepared two [npm] scripts:
- the first for building Demo Page files - `build:demo`
- the second for running the dev server - `start:demo`

Scripts using [Webpack] which use config file prepared for Demo Page. I just duplicated `config/dev.js` file and made some changes in it ([Added Demo - config file]).

## Scrollable Main Container

### The problem with height of Main Container

In Main Container appears all messages. When a message was added or deleted then the height of Main Container actualized. It was possible to cover all page's content when Main Container had many messages.

### How did I fix the problem?

I thought that the Main Container should have a fixed height and that it should be scrollable. This solved the problem of covering the content of the page by [SimpleDebugger].

## Things to do

- add CI
- add Code Coverage
- Create github page

## Things I done

- Create demo page
- Fix Main Container: Now it enlarges and would cover all window view
