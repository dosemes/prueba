I looked in my 4-year-old project which helped me debug mobile sites. The mobile browser didn’t have any way to debug code so I created [SimpleDebugger].

It works similar to `console.log()` but works on DOM.

I want to play with **SimpleDebugger** and do stuff right. For now there is no code in master branch and, honestly, this is weird. I thought that I didn’t have much time to do it right so… Yeah, I will fix this project. Why not :-)?

Things to do
- It has one dependency - jQuery and I will rid of it.
- I think to add gulp to do some minification, unit testing and other similiar stuff
