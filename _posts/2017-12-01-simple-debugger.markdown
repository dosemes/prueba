I looked in my 4-year-old project which helped me debug mobile sites. The mobile browsers didn’t have any way to debug code so I created [SimpleDebugger].

It works similar to `console.log()` but injects logs into DOM.

I want to play with **SimpleDebugger** and do stuff right. For now there is no code in master branch and, honestly, this is weird. I thought that I didn’t have much time to do it right in the past, so… Yeah, I will fix this project. Why not :-)?

Things to do
- It has one dependency - jQuery and I will rid of it.
- I think to add gulp to do some minification, unit testing, and other similar stuff
