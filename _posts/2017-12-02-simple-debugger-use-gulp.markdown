I installed [Gulp] and plugins.

I did some configuration.

I installed [BrowserSync].

Everything started work but I realized that I won't have support for newest ECMAScript. So... I've installed [Babel] and gulp plugin for it. And there started trouble.

I wanted that [SimpleDebugger] should be easily used in projects without dependencies needed to install. I want rid of [jQuery]. I love [jQuery]. The reason for ridding of it is that I don't want that [SimpleDebugger] had any dependencies.

The bundled file just didn't work in a browser. I dropped [Babel] after hours of figuring out how to fix it.

Today I started thinking that I should use [Babel] with [Webpack]. I will go that way. I think I will not need [Gulp] anymore and that is sad. I spend some time to configure [Gulp]. I think [Gulp] is the great tool and really easy to use.

Maybe I think about [Webpack] as a hard to use is that I do not really know how it should be configured. I know that [Webpack] is really powerful.

I want also use [BrowserSync] which I think is really cool and useful.

Things to do

- use [Webpack]
- use [Babel]
- configure [Webpack] to use [BrowserSync]
- rid of [Gulp] if it is necessary

Things done

- added [Gulp] and plugins
  - [gulp-concat]
  - [gulp-eslint]
  - [gulp-load-plugins]
  - [gulp-sourcemaps]
  - [gulp-uglify-es]
  - [gulp-util]
- [ESLint] configuration file

Things I didn't do

- It has one dependency - [jQuery] and I will rid of it.
